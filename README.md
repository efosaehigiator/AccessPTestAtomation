Practice test
I have created this file using Selenium with Java, cucumber and junit to run the tests. wrote test cases in BDD format to create the feature files, this was used to generate the step definitions to run the test. I have added cucumber extent report as well. the framework was developed using page object model, where I have created individula pages for the different functionalities under test.
